t                                                                              Hibernate 
                                        it is noting but a opject realtional mapping tool use to maap  java object and datbase table

                                                         orm-> is object relkational mapping where it can mapping the java obvjec to database

                                 what is advantage of hibernate over the jdbc :-
                                     1)it reduce the boiler plate
                                     2)it also support query which is object oriented 
                                    3)it povide the transectional managmant implicitly
                                    4) it throws the automtilly 


                                  what are teh intrefacrs use  in hibernate :_
                            1)session factory :-it is intanace of org.hybernate pakage  is use to retrive the seeeion objec data
                                             heavy weight and creatd only ones per database

                                     2) sessions :-it is iteface tha use to physiscal connection to the databse 
                                                    to creat a seesion we need sesion factory 
                                             base on requriment multipal session will be created 
   
                              3)  treansection:- is interface that that ensure the group operations prefome completely then it commit all if fail it rollback the preation
                                            it aslo make a cahanges in database as per the operaion the transection objett is use  44
